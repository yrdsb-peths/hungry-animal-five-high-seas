# Hungry Animal

To start the game, the user must press the **spacebar**. This removes the title screen and text instructions and places the elephant near the bottom of the screen.

Using the 'A' and 'D', or the **left** and **right** arrow keys, move an elephant to eat as many apples that are falling from the ceiling as possible until time runs out. The counter for the # of apples eaten is on the upper left hand corner and eating an apple will spawn another at the top of the screen. The apples will also fall quicker every 10 apples the elephant eats to speed up the game length.

If an apple falls to the bottom of the screen due to the elephant unable to reach it in time, the apple will be removed and a Game Over screen will be played.

*Note: The user can still move the elephant even if the game is over, furthermore resetting the game will also reset the high score counter.*

**Good luck!**
